          I am a sophomore at MIT studying Computer Science and Engineering. I also play volleyball there! My favorite
          things to do are watch movies, workout, and sing! In terms of computer science, I am most interested by
          machine learning and designing distributed systems. I also have a one eyed dog named Fergie and she is the
          love of my life.

          My friends and I are currently working on a project to improve the pipeline of aid to Africa using blockchain
          ledger technology. Before coming to Google, I worked at SoundHound, Inc. on their voice AI platform, as well
          as TripAdvisor on their Flights team where I automated their SQL update system, allowing non-computer
          scientists to be able to update databases by just typing into something as simple as an Excel spreadsheet.
