            <p>Here is a photo of me!</p>
            <img src="/images/ProfilePic.jpeg" alt="Profile Picture">
            <p>I am a sophomore at MIT studying Computer Science and Engineering. I also play volleyball there!
            My favorite things to do are watch movies, workout, and sing! In terms of computer science, I am most
            interested by machine learning and designing distributed systems. I also have a one eyed dog named
            Fergie and she is the love of my life.</p> 
            <p>My friends and I are currently
            working on a project to improve the pipeline of aid to Africa using blockchain, ledger technology. 
            Before coming to Google, I worked at SoundHound, Inc. on their voice AI platform, as well as TripAdvisor
            on their Flights team where I automated their SQL update system, allowing non-computer scientists to be 
            able to update databases by just typing into something as simple as an Excel spreadsheet.
